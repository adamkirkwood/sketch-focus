# Features
### Add notes and tasks to your document
Easily add notes and tasks (items) to your Sketch documents to keep track of what you need to do to particular layers, artboards or pages. Use `[CMD SHIFT F]` to open Sketch Focus and then toggle between notes and tasks using the `[TAB]` key.

### Link layers to items
Link layers to your items as you create them, or later on by selecting the layers you want to link to a particular item and then clicking `[Link selected layers]` inside the item you want to link the layers to.

### Jump directly to linked layers `[PRO]`
After linking layers to your items, simply click a layer's name or thumbnail to jump to it in your document. It will be selected and zoomed in for your convenience. You can also jump to any parent layers, all the way to the artboard and page.

### Mark items as important
Highlight items with a `[Star]` to label them as 'important'. You can then choose to only see important items by opening the `[Filter]` menu and checking `[Important items]`.

### Search items
Search your items by opening the `[Search]` menu and then entering your search string. You can also refine your search with additional filters in the `[Filter]` menu to only see the items you're looking for.

### Filter items by currently visible or selected layers `[PRO]`
Filter your items to only those that are linked to currently visible or selected layers by opening the `[Filter]` menu and checking `[Items linked to visible layers]` or `[Items linked to selected layers]`.

### Sort items by date or alphabetically
Sort your items by date or alphabetically by opening the `[Sort]` menu and choosing one of `[Newest first]`, `[Oldest first]`, `[A-Z]` and `[Z-A]`. Custom sorting will be added in an update in the near future.

### Customize UI color `[PRO]`

### Import and export data `[PRO]`
Open `[Settings]`, choose the `[Data]` tab and click 'Export data' to create a JSON file containing all of your notes and tasks. You can later import it back into any document you like. This is a must when you have mission critical information in your items.
