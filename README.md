# Features
### Add notes and tasks to your document
Easily add notes and tasks (items) to your Sketch documents to keep track of what you need to do to particular layers, artboards or pages. Use `[CMD SHIFT F]` to open Sketch Focus and then toggle between notes and tasks using the `[TAB]` key.

### Link layers to items
Link layers to your items as you create them, or later on by selecting the layers you want to link to a particular item and then clicking Link selected layers inside the item you want to link the layers to.

### Jump directly to linked layers `[PRO]`
After linking layers to your items, simply click a layer's name or thumbnail to jump to it in your document. It will be selected and zoomed in for your convenience. You can also jump to any parent layers, all the way to the artboard and page.
